# Zombie Defender - [Play it.](https://jprpanebianco.github.io/defender.html)
A mouse-to-aim shooter sans zombies. Sans walking animations.

This prototype looks a little more polished. The main goals of the project were to practice simple animations and see if mouse aiming could be any fun.

I think it could be. I particularly like using the shotgun.

I had originally conceived of a woman defending a small outpost from zombies. You could use the mouse to set up traps and collect coins to purchase more sophisticated defenses. Kind of a tower defense/shooter hybrid. But I think I would remove the barrier and just make the player run and gun.
